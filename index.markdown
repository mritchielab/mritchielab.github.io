The Ritchie Lab at the [Walter and Eliza Hall Medical Research Institute](https://www.wehi.edu.au/laboratory/ritchie-lab/#block_1249c5f625ba10535e447a4e7dfeba56_8) uses statistical methodologies to provide new insights into the genetic basis of health and disease. We develop specialised analysis methods for large and complex biological datasets. Our research has accelerated the development of more effective cancer therapies and our statistical methods are extensively used by researchers worldwide to make new discoveries.
